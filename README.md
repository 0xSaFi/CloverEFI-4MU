# Clover4nonMac
First, I've to tell that Clover binary used on this repo is same as what we could get from <b>Official SourceForge</b> [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/files/Bootable_ISO/).
So, it definitely is able to boot OS X / macOS as well.

However, I decided to make it as separated topic for answering a question:
"How to use Clover UEFI w/o installing Mac?".
