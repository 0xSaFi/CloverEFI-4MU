# CloverEFI-wo-Hackintosh
### Introduction 
First, I have to tell that Clover binary used on this repo is same as what you could get from <b>Official SourceForge</b> [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/files/Bootable_ISO/). So, it definitely is able to boot OS X / macOS as well (if your mach is Hackintosh compatible).
 
But, I decided to make a separated topic for answering a question: "How to use Clover w/o installing macOS on UEFI PC?". As we've known, provided Clover [Package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.pkg) is installable only on a Hackintosh based with macOS running.
