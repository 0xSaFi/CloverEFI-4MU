# Clover4nonMac
First, I've to tell that Clover binary used on this repo is same as what we could get from [Official SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/files/Bootable_ISO/). So, it definitely is able to boot OS X / macOS as well.

However, I decided to make it as separated topic for answering a question: "How to install Clover w/o Mac?".
